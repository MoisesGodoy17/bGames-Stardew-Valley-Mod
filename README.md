bGames is a technology designed to create a balance between daily activities and video games. Your daily tasks help you improve in games! With bGames, you can earn points based on your daily activities. Using sensors, your data is collected and transformed into points, which can be used to enhance your character in the game.

This concept led to the development of this mod for Stardew Valley, integrating bGames directly into the game.  
In the mod, you can exchange your bGames points for temporary abilities (Buffs) or improve your character by leveling up skills with your points.

- You cannot activate more than two temporary abilities at the same timeâ€”only one at a time!
- To use the mod correctly, you must configure bGames (instructions are provided at the end of the post).
- bGames points spent in the mod cannot be recovered; once used, they cannot be refunded.
- If you go to sleep with an active Buff, it will be lost! Plan when to activate it to make the most of its effects.
- bGames technology is constantly expanding; however, at the moment, it is not possible to create an account. Instead, pre-generated accounts with points will be provided so you can use the mod.
